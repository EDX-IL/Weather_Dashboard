## Overview

### The challenge

Describe the challenge here

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Useful resources

- [OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) - This documentation helped me convert the geographical name to co-ordinates
- [OpenWeatherMap 5 Day Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) - This documentation help me understand how to use the API to retrieve the 5 day weather forecast from OpenWeatherMap
- [Local Storage Documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - This helped my implement the local storage element on my project.
- [Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) - This helped with an explanation of how to use variables in strings using backticks
